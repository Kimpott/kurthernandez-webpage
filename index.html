        <p><center>Hi, I am Kurt Miguel Hernandez, 18 years old. I'm currently living in 
        Los Banos Laguna together with my 3 siblings. I am studying at Laguna State Polytechnic University 
        taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.  <br>
        Maybe you are wondering what kind of personality I have, What are my likes and dislikes and what are my hobbies and talents.
        <br>so let me tell you about myself.</center> </p>

            <h1 class="headings">PERSONALITIES</h1>
            <p>I am the type of person who is kind, cheerful, polite, introvert, quiet but observant, easily get annoyed even in small things, low self-esteem,
                easily get irritated, open minded, I'm not that friendly but i'm approachable naman. I'm also straight forward, I'm also makakalimutin. I immediately forgot the things
                that were just told to me. sometimes 
                when I'm comfortable with my kasama, like firends I'm kinda bully. etc. those are just some of my personalities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="box">
            <h1 class="headings">LIKES AND DISLIKES</h1>
            <p>I like it when someone remember little things about me, when someone aya me with their gala, when someone respect my no or my decisions, 
                when someone is willing to help me even though they have things to do. as for my dislikes, I hate it when I'm in badmood then I will accidentanlly 
                bump my head or slip or when I watching something in social media but then the wifi will suddenly slow down. those are just some of my likes and dislikes.
            </p>

                <h1 class="headings">HOBBIES AND TALENTS</h1>
                <p>My hobbies are listening to music, I also love to sing even though I'm not that good at singing but maybe 
                    I can consider that as my talent. I also know how to draw and I occationally do drawing but I'm often too lazy to draw.
                    sometimes I'm playing some online games when my friends invite me to play.I dont have many hobbies and talents so I often spend my time 
                    scrolling on social media or just wasting my time on useless things.
